Advantages of Polymorphism in Java

1.Increases code reusability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class.
2.Improves readability and maintainability of code by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained.
3.Supports dynamic binding, enabling the correct method to be called at runtime, based on the actual class of the object.
4.Enables objects to be treated as a single type, making it easier to write generic code that can handle objects of different types.

Disadvantages of Polymorphism in Java

1.Can make it more difficult to understand the behavior of an object, especially if the code is complex.
2.This may lead to performance issues, as polymorphic behavior may require additional computations at runtime.
