The toString() provides a String representation of an object and is used to convert an object to a String. The default toString() method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `@’, and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, it is defined as:



// Default behavior of toString() is to print class name, then
// @, then unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code
// of the object

public String toString()
{
    return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
}

It is always recommended to override the toString() method to get our own String representation of Object. For more on override of toString() method refer – Overriding toString() in Java 

Note: Whenever we try to print any Object reference, then internally toString() method is called.

Student s = new Student();

// Below two statements are equivalent
System.out.println(s);
System.out.println(s.toString());
